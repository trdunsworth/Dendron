I'm curious to see how this is going to work as a second brain and how I can make it work better for me.

## Morning

I slept decently overnight. I am also happy that the new keyboard and mouse are working properly after a full overnight charge. I like their products and I'm enjoying it working.

### Gratitude

I am grateful for:

1. My spouse and what we've built together.
2.
3.

### What would make today great?

1. Getting rid of this headaches
2.
3.

### Daily affirmations

I am...fallable and that is ok. I can do many things and do them well, but I don't have to be perfect at all times.

## Work notes

Took care of the new application to the Staffing Guidelines WG. I also got the NGPSAP agenda out after hearing from Michael.

Just received an interesting email from Terry Reese from MCP. I'm noticing that I'm becoming their go-to for different things. On one hand, I'm honoured that they feel comfortable reaching out to me. On the other, I feel like I'm being tested to see how I will integrate with their team prior to getting an offer to join their team. I have been expecting to be recruited by them for some time. I remember that Jenna told me that I've been on their radar screens for quite some time.

I've noticed that Destiny has been out all week. There was no notice, *as usual*, so I'm left to take care of some of the boring crap that needs done. I will get some of that stuff done this afternoon. I just looked at a request and found that it was directly sent to me. I don't know if Jo Jo sent it to me because she knew that Destiny was out of the office and didn't want to go through DEC_Technical_Support or she doesn't have any confidence in Destiny taking care of it, so she sent it to me. It's hard to tell which is which. 

Got an interesting request for statistics from Gabi this morning. She said that Dr. Mafori wants to know how often we need a language line. Looks like just a bit over 0.51% of calls might require a language request. That was kind of surprising. I thought, considering the population, there would be more.
